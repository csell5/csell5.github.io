      <h2>Just who is Clark Sell?</h2>
      <p>I’m a very passionate, entrepreneurial person whose love for developing software was born from my obsessive passion for building and customizing automobiles. This love of creativity, this love of building, creating, lead me to software development. Like the automobile shrunk the world, the computer helped people scale. I love the Web. I love Mobile Apps. I love IoT and how it’s easier than ever to get a small micro controller to just do a thing. Technology is changing the world, and I am glad to be a small part of it.</p>
