								<h2>Hi! My Name is <span class="special">Clark Sell</span>
									<br />
									<br />
								Entrepreneur, Software Craftsman,
									<br/>
								Speaker and Fabricator</h2>
								<p>
									I’m a very passionate, entrepreneurial person whose love for developing software was born from my passion for building and customizing automobiles. This love, has led me to a dedicated life of enterprise software architecture and development for some of the biggest companies in the world. Just like the cars I’ve built, I love how the web, mobile, and IoT applications are connecting our world together while advancing our society.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now I'm taking that enterprise experience to small businesses everywhere.

								<h2>Product Management<br />
								and Development</h2>
								<p>From ideation to production, I’ve built and managed some of the best software teams in the world. Building requires experience in UX, UI, Software Development, Marketing, Sales, and Support. Your product and its ultimate success is more than just code.</p>

								<h2>Software Architecture<br />
								and Development</h2>
								<p>Just like the automobile, software is at my core. I’ve designed and built Websites, Mobile Apps, Backend APIs, Devices, whatever. Computers are just tools, and software is just the language. It’s all about how you make software work for you and your business, but software needs to be designed correctly from the start *before* it becomes another headache for you to manage.</p>

								<h2>Fabrication<br />
								and Automobiles</h2>
								<p>I’m fascinated with the automobile and everything that surrounds it. The creation, the tools, how they are customized, and of course how they make people feel. For me, the automobile is a historical icon of American freedom. I’ve grown up customizing automobiles and have restored a few of my own. You’re only bound by your own creativity, just like in software.</p>

								<h2>BBQ</h2>
								<p>What does BBQ have to do with software? Well *everything*, of course! Just like building software, great BBQ is the representation of the Pitmaster who smoked it. It’s an art, a craft, something that cannot be mastered overnight, but yet must be cooked overnight.</p>
